* todo
** [ ] pull in Log.gd from Dothop/dino
** [ ] create example scene and script that uses it
** [ ] add gdunit
** [ ] write some tests
** [ ] github actions running tests
** [ ] write readme
*** features, with code and screenshots
**** pretty-printing primitives
**** pretty-printing arrays and dicts
**** opting-in to prettier/limited classes/objects
*** _not_ a production log-to-file helper
but maybe that's a future direction
** [ ] write and submit to godot asset library
** [ ] create docs website
check out pandora's tooling
** [ ] consider csharp implementation
** [ ] list other godot asset lib loggers
